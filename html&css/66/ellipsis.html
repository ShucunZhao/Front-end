		One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited. “Come and play with me,” The tree said. “I don’t have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for a shelter. Can you help me?” “Sorry, but I don’t have a house. But you can cut off my branches to build your house.” So the boy cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy, but the boy didn’t appear since then.
